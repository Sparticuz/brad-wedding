<p>Brad &amp; I met during our first few days at the Ringling College of Art and Design. We were on our way back from one of the orientation activities, and I saw him sitting on the bus. Brad was wearing a Sanctus Real tee shirt (a Christian rock band that I also really liked) and I decided that I absolutely had to meet this attractive guy with my tastes in music. I sat next to him, introduced myself, and drummed up a conversation. We ended up in the same graphic design classes freshman &amp; sophomore year and became friends, talking about music and school, and going to concerts and hanging out with our friend Jesse. </p>
  <p>Life took us many places during college, but Brad and I always ended up together. By junior year we were best friends, and my (more or less constant) crush on Brad began to blossom into something more. During Christmas break of junior year, we took a trip to Seattle with friends and fell in love with the city (and each other!) We started dating the day before Valentines Day 2008. </p>
  <p>After an amazing year of being together, Brad and I took another trip to Seattle for Spring Break 2009. We had a bunch of job interviews lined up, but before them we planned to go to the Space Needle restaurant, Sky City, for a date. On our walk to the Space Needle, it started to lightly snow. Our dinner was amazing, looking out over the city where we plan to start our new life. After dinner, Brad got down on one knee and asked me to marry him! It was an amazing night, the best of our lives so far! </p>
  <p>We're both graduating from Ringling May 8th, and moving to Seattle in June. We're very excited to come back in September and get married in Sarasota, where we met! For our honeymoon, we are going on a 7 day Royal Caribbean cruise to Alaska. We are excited to relax, see the sights, go whale watching, and enjoy our first newlywed days! </p>
